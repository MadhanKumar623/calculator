Hi all,
My name is Madhan Kumar, I have done this project as the part of ECEN academy under the guidance of Mr. Balaji Seshadree sir.

This repository consists of two calculator programs
1. 50 digit calculator using C program.
2. Normal calculator using atmega2560 board, keypad and LCD using my own register level coding.

Thank you.
